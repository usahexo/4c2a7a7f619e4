#  Kendall County Holds Millions in Gambling Winnings!

According to a recent article released by the Kendall County Record, the county has over $3 million in gambling winnings from the Illinois Lottery and horse racing.

The bulk of the winnings, over $2 million, comes from the Illinois Lottery. Kendall County residents have won big on scratch-off tickets, with some taking home jackpots of $100,000 or more.

Horse racing has also been a boon for the county, with nearly $1 million in winnings so far this year. bettors at Hawthorne Racecourse in Cicero and Arlington International Racecourse near Chicago have enjoyed successful days at the track, padding their bank accounts with winning bets.

While it's fun to watch people win big bucks, it's also important to remember that these proceeds provide much-needed funding for local services and projects. The money raised through gambling helps pay for things like road repairs, police and fire protection, and parks and recreation facilities.

So next time you buy a lottery ticket or place a bet at the race track, take a moment to think about what your hard-earned money is going towards. You may not be able to hit the jackpot yourself, but you're helping to make your community a better place.
