#  Try Your Luck With 4 Card Poker Hands Games Free Slots!

There is something about 4 card poker hands games free slots that just seems to appeal to players of all levels of experience and expertise.

The basic premise of 4 card poker hands games free slots is to make the best possible five-card poker hand from the four cards that are dealt to you. The ranking of the hands from worst to best is as follows: two pair, one pair, high card, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, and royal flush. Unlike traditional poker where you are playing against other players, in 4 card poker hands games free slots you are playing against the dealer.

The first thing you need to do when playing 4 card poker hands games free slots is decide how much money you want to bet. Once you have done that, you need to make two equal bets - one on the table and one in your hand. After that, three cards will be dealt face up on the table and one will be dealt face down in your hand. You now have two choices - either fold your hand and lose both bets or continue playing by betting another equal amount on top of the first two bets. If you choose to continue playing, then one more card will be revealed in your hand and one more on the table. If at this point you have not folded then the fourth and final card will be revealed and your final hand will be compared to that of the dealer's.

If you are new to 4 card poker hands games free slots then it is important to start off slowly until you get a feel for how the game works. There are no real strategy involved so just go with what feels comfortable for you and increase your bets as you become more confident.
