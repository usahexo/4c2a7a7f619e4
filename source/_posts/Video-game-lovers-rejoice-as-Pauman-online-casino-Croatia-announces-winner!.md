#  Who will be crowned the new king of casino games - video poker, roulette or blackjack?

Casino games are some of the most popular around the world and there are many different types to choose from. Each game has its own set of rules and strategies, which means that some games are better suited for certain players than others. In this article, we will take a look at three of the most popular casino games: video poker, roulette and blackjack and decide who is likely to come out on top.

# Video Poker

Video poker is a relatively new casino game that has become increasingly popular in recent years. The basic premise of the game is similar to that of traditional poker, but players play against the machine rather than against other players. The advantage of video poker is that it is relatively easy to learn, but there are still plenty of opportunities for strategy and skill.

# Roulette

Roulette is a classic casino game that has been around for centuries. The game is simple enough – players bet on where they think the ball will land after spinning around the wheel. However, roulette can be a very lucrative game if you know what you’re doing. There are many different betting options available and experienced players can make huge profits by correctly predicting the outcome of each spin.

# Blackjack

Blackjack is another classic casino game that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Blackjack can be a challenging game but it also offers plenty of opportunities for strategic play. Experienced blackjack players can often reduce the house edge to less than 1%.

#  Could this new video game be the one to take down the top dogs at Pauman online casino Croatia?
