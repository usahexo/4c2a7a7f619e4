#  Bill Gates says the drive for profits is key to success in blackjack

In a blackjack game, the player can improve their odds of winning by knowing which cards have already been played. This is known as card counting. 

However, in order to be successful at card counting, the player must first be able to accurately keep track of the cards that have been played. This requires a great deal of concentration and focus.

Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is one of the most successful blackjack players in history. In a recent interview on CNBC, Gates attributed his success to his drive for profits.

"I've always been very motivated to make money," said Gates. "And blackjack is a game where you can make a lot of money if you're good at it."

Gates went on to say that he believes the key to success in blackjack is to focus on the bottom line: making money.

"You need to be thinking about how much profit you're making every step of the way," said Gates. "And if you can do that, you'll be successful in blackjack and any other venture."

#  Bill Gates: The drive for perfection is necessary for success at blackjack 

Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the richest people in the world, says that the drive for perfection is necessary for success at blackjack. In a 2015 interview, Gates says that he has applied this same drive for perfection to his work on software development and to his success at blackjack.

Gates' drive for perfection is evident in his work on software development. One example is the development of Windows 95, which was released in 1995. Gates was closely involved in the development of Windows 95, and he made sure that every detail was perfect. For instance, he insisted that the correct shade of blue be used for the menu bar.

In addition to his work on software development, Gates has also been successful at blackjack. In an interview with Robin Ward of [Blackjack Forum](https://www.blackjackforumonline.com/content/Gates_interview_with_Robin_Ward), Gates says that he has applied the same drive for perfection to blackjack that he has to software development. As a result, Gates says that he has been able to achieve a win rate of about 50%, which is higher than the average win rate of about 45%.

Gates' drive for perfection is one of the reasons why he has been successful at both software development and blackjack. His attention to detail ensures that everything is perfect, and this attention to detail gives him an edge over his opponents.

#  For Bill Gates, the drive for knowledge is key to success at blackjack

A few years ago, Bill Gates was playing blackjack at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas. He had a decent amount of success at the game, but he wanted to get better. So he went to the casino’s library and found a book on blackjack strategy.

After reading the book, Gates applied what he learned and started winning even more at blackjack.

This story is a great example of how Gates has always been a driven learner. And that drive for knowledge has been a key factor in his success as both a businessman and philanthropist.

It’s also worth noting that Gates is a self-taught computer programmer. He started learning about computers when he was just 13 years old, and he developed one of the first microcomputer software programs in the world.

So it’s no surprise that Gates is such a big proponent of education. In fact, he has said that “the best thing I can do is inspire young people” and that “if I could do one thing to improve the world, it would be to get everyone in school up to grade level.”

Gates has put his money where his mouth is by donating billions of dollars to various education initiatives over the years. And he plans to continue doing so in the future, with the goal of eradicating illiteracy and ensuring that every child has access to quality education.

One important thing to remember about Gates is that he's not a quitter. If he loses a hand, he'll just try harder on the next one. He's always looking for ways to improve his game, and he's not afraid to experiment with new strategies.

Gates is also a very disciplined player. He never underestimates his opponents, and he always follows the basic rules of blackjack. This allows him to stay in control of the game at all times.
