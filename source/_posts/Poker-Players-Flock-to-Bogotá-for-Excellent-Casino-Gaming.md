#  Poker Players Flock to Bogotá for Excellent Casino Gaming

The Colombia capital city of Bogotá is becoming a popular destination for international poker players, as the many excellent casinos in the city offer some of the best gaming opportunities in South America.

#  Take a Chance: Play Poker in Colombia

Do you love a good poker game? Do you want to test your skills in an exotic location? Then look no further than Bogota, Colombia!

There are plenty of casinos in Bogota where you can take on the locals and see if you can walk away with some serious cash. Don't be intimidated by the language barrier – most Colombians are more than happy to help out a foreigner who's willing to try their luck at the tables.

But be warned: poker is a popular game in Colombia, and the competition can be fierce. If you're not prepared to put in some hard work, you're likely to end up losing your money (and your dignity) very quickly.

So if you're feeling brave, why not give poker in Colombia a go? You may just find yourself becoming a regular at the casino tables!

#  Poker Comes to Colombia

Poker is coming to Colombia. But don't worry, there won't be any shootouts over the final table.

The Colombian Poker Tour (CPT) is a new poker tournament series that is set to debut in late 2019. The tour will consist of five major tournaments, each with a different buy-in level.

The CPT is the brainchild of poker player and businessman Andrés Poveda. Poveda has been playing poker for over a decade and has been involved in the game in one way or another ever since. He decided to launch the CPT as a way to give back to the game that has given him so much enjoyment over the years.

"I've always loved being involved in poker," said Poveda in an interview with PokerNews Colombia. "First as a player, then as an organizer, and now as CEO of the Colombian Poker Tour. I want to give back to the game what it's given me: happiness, adrenaline, and many friends."

The inaugural CPT event will take place at the Majestic Casino in Bogotá on November 23rd-24th, 2019. The tour will then move on to different parts of Colombia, including Medellín, Cartagena, Bucaramanga, and Cali. The final event of the tour will be a $1,000 No Limit Hold'em tournament that will take place at the Gran Casino de Cali on January 25th-26th, 2020.

Aside from the main events, there will also be a variety of side events offered during each stop on the tour. These include but are not limited to: Omaha Hi/Lo Split 8 or Better, Texas Hold'em Turbo 6-Max Deepstack, Pot Limit Omaha 6-Max Hyper Turbo Freezeout, and Ladies Event - No Limit Hold'em Freezeout.

While there are other poker tours that are currently active in Colombia (such as Latin American Poker Tour - LAPT and South American Poker Tour - SAPT), Poveda believes that the CPT offers something unique that these other tours do not.
