#  What companies will benefit most from the changes?

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide significant tax relief to American businesses of all sizes. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the new law will reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.

But not all businesses will benefit equally from the changes. Here are three companies that will likely benefit most from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:

1. Apple

Apple is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new tax law. The company expects its global effective tax rate to decline from 26 percent to 19 percent as a result of the new legislation. This will save Apple billions of dollars in taxes each year.

In addition, the corporate tax cut in the new law will allow Apple to repatriate its overseas profits at a lower cost. As a result, Apple is likely to bring back a significant portion of its $252 billion in foreign profits. This could lead to significant investment and job creation in the United States.

2. Amazon

Amazon is another company that stands to benefit from the new tax law. The online retailer is expected to see its effective tax rate fall from 26 percent to 23 percent as a result of the corporate tax cut. This will save Amazon billions of dollars in taxes each year.

In addition, Amazon may use some of its savings to increase its dividend payments and share buybacks. The company has already announced plans to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour, so it's likely that most of the benefits from the tax cut will be reinvested back into the business.

3. Walmart

Walmart is another company that stands to benefit significantly from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The retail giant expects its effective tax rate to decline from 30 percent to 21 percent as a result of the new law. This will save Walmart billions of dollars in taxes each year.

Walmart plans to use some of those savings to invest in new stores, distribution centers, and e-commerce initiatives. The company also plans to raise its starting wage rate and give employees bonuses up to $1,000. In all, Walmart expects to spend $20 billion on employee compensation and training over the next two years thanks to the lower corporate tax rate in the new law.

#  What new opportunities will arise as a result of these changes?

The impending technological changes, brought about by the fourth industrial revolution, will present society with new opportunities for growth and development. First and foremost amongst these changes is the increasing prevalence of internet-connected devices and the expansion of the internet of things (IoT). Secondly, there is the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which is set to usher in a new age of automation.

Both of these technologies are set to have a profound impact on the world economy. The IoT is expected to grow from an $US8 trillion industry in 2020 to a $US11 trillion industry by 2025. AI is also forecast to contribute an additional $US15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, thanks to increased productivity and innovation.

As a result of these changes, businesses will need to embrace digital transformation in order to remain competitive. This will include upgrading their infrastructure to enable internet-connected devices, as well as investing in AI and ML applications. Governments too will need to adapt, by creating policies that facilitate the growth of the IoT and AI industries.

The fourth industrial revolution offers immense opportunities for growth and development. Businesses that embrace digital transformation will be best placed to take advantage of these changes, while governments must create policies that facilitate innovation.
