The developers of Rocket Reels decided to omit the gambling option from the game in order to make it more accessible to a wider audience.

#  Gambling Removed From Upcoming Rocket Reels Game

In a sudden move, gambling has been removed from the upcoming Rocket Reels game. The game's developers released a statement to say that they had made the decision in light of concerns raised by players about the possible negative effects of gambling on their mental health and well-being.

"We want to create a gaming experience that is enjoyable and fun for everyone," the developers said in their statement. "And while we believe that gambling can be a fun and rewarding part of gameplay for some players, we also recognise that for others it can be detrimental to their mental health and well-being.

"So after careful consideration, we have decided that it is best to remove gambling from Rocket Reels altogether. We hope that this change will create a more positive and healthy gaming experience for all our players."

The decision to remove gambling from Rocket Reels has drawn mixed reactions from the game's community. Some players are happy that the developers are putting player welfare first, while others feel that they are being denied an important element of the game.

Nevertheless, the decision is likely to be welcomed by many who feel that gambling can be addictive and dangerous. It remains to be seen whether other developers will follow suit and remove gambling from their games in light of these concerns.
