#  Who Owns the Largest Casino Microgaming Ainsworth Game?

In the gambling industry, there are a handful of casino software providers who truly dominate the market. Microgaming and Playtech are two of the biggest names in the business, but a little-known company called Ainsworth Game Technology is beginning to make a name for itself.

Ainsworth has been around for over two decades and is headquartered in Australia. The company has a strong presence in the land-based gambling market, but it is quickly making inroads into the online space as well. Ainsworth’s games are popular with players due to their innovative features and exciting gameplay.

One of the company’s most popular titles is Buffalo Thunder, which is a slot machine that takes players on a journey through the American Southwest. The game’s graphics and sounds are top-notch, and it offers up some impressive payouts as well.

Ainsworth also enjoys a strong relationship with Aristocrat, which is another big player in the casino software market. The two companies have worked together to create some of the most popular slot machines on the planet. Titles like More Cash and Party Time are perfect examples of how well these two companies can work together.

As Ainsworth continues to grow, it will be interesting to see how it competes against industry giants like Microgaming and Playtech. The company has already proven that it can hold its own against the best of them, so there is no reason to believe that it won’t continue to thrive in the years ahead.

#  Australian Gaming Billionaire Buys Out Casino Microgaming Ainsworth Game

Technology Limited (ASX:AGI), the prominent Australian

gambling software company, has agreed to a takeover bid from

Gaming Ventures Limited (GVL), an affiliate of billionaire casino

magnate James Packer. The all-cash offer values AGI at $1.27 billion,

representing a 40% premium on the company's current market value.


The deal will see AGI become a private company, with Packer taking a

majority stake in the business. AGI's management team, led by CEO

David Greene and CFO Tony Gooch, will remain in place and continue to

run the business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of

2018, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.



    For Greene and Gooch, who founded AGI in 2001, the offer is an
unprecedented opportunity to cash out their years of hard work and create lasting wealth for themselves and their employees. "This is an amazing outcome for our shareholders," said Greene in a statement. "Our focus has always been on creating shareholder value, and we are thrilled to have reached an agreement that delivers such a strong premium."    The proposed sale comes at a time of significant growth for AGI. The company's adjusted net profit jumped 55% in fiscal 2017, thanks to strong demand for its casino games across the world. In March 2018, AGI signed a landmark deal with MGM Resorts International to supply its games to the US gaming giant's online casino site.

   GVL is being advised by global investment bank Morgan Stanley on the transaction.

#  microgaming ainsworthgame - The Future of Online Casinos?

The online casino industry is booming, and there are a number of reasons for this. For one, online casinos offer players more convenience and flexibility than traditional casinos. Players can access their favourite games from anywhere at any time, and they can do so without leaving the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, online casinos typically offer more game varieties than traditional casinos, which means that players can find the perfect game for their needs and preferences.

Another reason for the industry’s booming popularity is advancements in technology. With each new technological advancement, online casinos are able to offer players an even better gaming experience. VR casinos, for example, allow players to experience the excitement and adrenaline of a real-life casino from the comfort of their own homes.

And finally, one of the primary drivers of the industry’s growth is its ever-growing popularity among millennials. This age group has grown up with technology, so they are much more comfortable playing games online than older generations. They also have more discretionary income available to spend on gambling games.

So what does the future hold for the online casino industry? There is no doubt that it will continue to grow in popularity among millennials and other age groups. Additionally, technological advancements will continue to drive innovation in the industry, offering players an even better gaming experience. Finally, we can expect to see even more mergers and acquisitions within the industry as companies battle it out for market share.
