Players can earn points faster and enjoy even more perks, such as free play, dining discounts, and more.

The new tier system is based on a point system. Players start at the bronze level and work their way up to the platinum level. The more points they earn, the better the rewards they receive. Points are earned by playing slots, table games, or poker. They can also be earned by participating in special promotions or events.

Players who are new to Pala Casino Resort and Spa can take advantage of a special promotion called “New Player’s First Two Days.” This promotion allows new players to earn double points on their first two days of play. This is a great way to start earning points quickly and move up through the tiers faster.

The perks of the new tier system are impressive. Players at the platinum level can enjoy free play valued at up to $1,000 per day! They can also receive discounts on dining and other resort amenities. Plus, they get invited to exclusive events and promotions throughout the year.

The new tier system is a great way for players to earn more rewards for their loyalty. It’s easy to participate and there are plenty of perks available for those who reach the platinum level. So start playing today and see how quickly you can work your way up to the top!
