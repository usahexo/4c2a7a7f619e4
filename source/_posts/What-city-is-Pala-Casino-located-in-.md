The property has since undergone several expansions, most recently in late 2017 when it added a new multi-level parking garage. The casino now spans 118,000 square feet and features more than 2,000 slot machines and over 60 table games. It also has a 24-hour poker room, high limit gaming salon, and two restaurants.

Pala Casino is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
