One popular activity is gambling, but if you’re looking to do some gambling during your Hawaiian vacation, you’ll be out of luck – most cruise ships in Hawaii don’t offer any form of gambling.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. For starters, Hawaii has a 3 km limit on gambling – any ship within 3 km of the shoreline is considered to be in Hawaiian waters and is subject to the state’s gambling laws. Secondly, there’s simply not enough demand for gambling in Hawaii to make it worth the cruise lines’ while. Finally, the fact that Hawaii is an American state also plays a role – since gambling is illegal on land in most of the United States, there’s not much demand for it on cruises either.</p>
<p>Some cruise lines do offer poker or blackjack tournaments occasionally, but these are generally limited to passengers who are already on board the ship. There are no casinos in Hawaii that cater specifically to cruise ship passengers – if you want to gamble while in Hawaii, you’ll have to do so on land.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of gambling options on cruise ships sailing in Hawaiian waters, there are still plenty of things to do in this exotic destination. From surfing and snorkeling to hiking and whale watching, there’s something for everyone in Hawaii. So if you’re looking to experience all that this beautiful state has to offer, book a cruise and enjoy everything that Hawaii has to offer!</p>
<h1 id="No-Gambling-on-Cruise-Ships-in-Hawaii-–-Why"><a href="#No-Gambling-on-Cruise-Ships-in-Hawaii-–-Why" class="headerlink" title="No Gambling on Cruise Ships in Hawaii – Why?"></a>No Gambling on Cruise Ships in Hawaii – Why?</h1><p>Cruise ships that stop in Hawaii are not allowed to offer any form of gambling, whether it is in the casino or on a deck game such as poker. The law is meant to protect the citizens of Hawaii from gambling addiction, and it has been in place for many years.</p>
<p>There are some people who argue that the law should be changed so that cruise ship passengers can gamble while in Hawaii. They say that it would be a great attraction for the tourists, and that it would bring in more money for the state. However, there are others who believe that the current law is best for Hawaii. They point out that gambling can be addictive, and that it can ruin lives.</p>
<p>There is no question that gambling can be addictive. In fact, it is considered to be a form of addiction akin to drugs or alcohol. For some people, it can be impossible to resist the lure of gambling, and they will spend all of their money on games of chance. This can lead to financial disaster, as well as other problems such as depression and suicide.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that many people believe that gambling should not be allowed in Hawaii. They feel that it could harm the citizens of the state, and that it is not worth the risk. While there are some who disagree with this position, the majority seems to support the current law regarding gambling on cruise ships in Hawaii.</p>
<h1 id="Why-No-Gambling-on-Cruise-Ships-in-Hawaii"><a href="#Why-No-Gambling-on-Cruise-Ships-in-Hawaii" class="headerlink" title="Why No Gambling on Cruise Ships in Hawaii?"></a>Why No Gambling on Cruise Ships in Hawaii?</h1><p>Hawaii is a beautiful and popular destination for cruise ships. However, gambling is not allowed on cruise ships that stop in Hawaii. Many people are curious as to why this is the case.</p>
<p>The reason that gambling is not allowed on cruise ships in Hawaii is because of the Polynesian Cultural Center. This center is located in Laie, O’ahu, and it is operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The center showcases the cultures of various Polynesian islands, and it has a large lū’au (a traditional Hawaiian feast).</p>
<p>The LDS Church bought the center in 1962, and it became one of the church’s “Mormon Temples.” The church does not allow gambling in its temples, so it does not allow gambling on cruise ships that stop in Hawaii.</p>
<p>There have been efforts to change this policy, but so far they have been unsuccessful. In 2009, then-Governor Linda Lingle proposed a bill that would have allowed gambling on cruise ships that stopped in Hawaii, but the bill did not pass.</p>
<p>Many people oppose gambling on cruise ships in Hawaii because they believe it would be harmful to the tourism industry. They believe that people would rather visit casinos in Las Vegas or other destinations than gamble on cruise ships in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Others support gambling on cruise ships in Hawaii because they believe it would be a boon to the local economy. They argue that allowing gambling on cruise ships would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>So far, however, the state has chosen to prohibit gambling on cruise ships.</p>
<h1 id="Lack-of-Gambling-on-Cruises-from-Hawaii-Could-be-Killing-Business"><a href="#Lack-of-Gambling-on-Cruises-from-Hawaii-Could-be-Killing-Business" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Gambling on Cruises from Hawaii Could be Killing Business"></a>Lack of Gambling on Cruises from Hawaii Could be Killing Business</h1><p>The Hawaii Cruise Association has been fighting for years to get lawmakers in the state to approve gambling on cruise ships that depart from ports in Hawaii. However, the measure has continually failed, and now the association says it may be costing the state jobs and revenue.</p>
<p>According to recent data, there were just 7,000 cruise passengers who gambled on cruises departing from Hawaii in 2016. That’s compared to nearly 169,000 passengers who gambled on cruises departing from other U.S. ports.</p>
<p>Many experts believe that if gambling were legalized in Hawaii, that number would grow significantly, as more people would choose to cruise from Hawaii knowing they could gamble on board. In fact, a study conducted by the University of Nevada Las Vegas found that legalizing gambling on cruises departing from Hawaii could bring in an additional $46 million per year in tourism revenue.</p>
<p>That’s money that could be used to support local businesses and create jobs in the tourism industry. It’s also money that could be used to help offset the cost of operating the state’s airports and seaports.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like legalization is likely to happen any time soon. Lawmakers have been resistant to legalize gambling, largely because of the concerns raised by parents groups about its impact on children.</p>
<p>However, with so much money potentially at stake, it’s likely that the debate over gambling will continue in Hawaii for many years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Cruise-Ship-Gambling-in-Hawaii-Remains-Limited"><a href="#Cruise-Ship-Gambling-in-Hawaii-Remains-Limited" class="headerlink" title="Cruise Ship Gambling in Hawaii Remains Limited"></a>Cruise Ship Gambling in Hawaii Remains Limited</h1><p>In spite of the fact that Hawaii is a popular cruise destination, the gambling options on cruise ships visiting the state remain limited. This is due in part to a 1932 state law that prohibits most types of gambling within Hawaii’s borders.</p>
<p>As a result, only a few cruise ships offer any form of gambling while in Hawaiian waters. These include vessels operated by Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. All other major cruise operators do not offer casino gaming while in Hawaii.</p>
<p>This situation could change, however, as California has recently lifted its own restrictions on gambling aboard cruise ships operating within its territorial waters. It remains to be seen if this will have any impact on gambling options available to cruise passengers sailing through Hawaiian waters.</p>
