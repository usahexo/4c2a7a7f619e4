            <h1 id="Sports-Betting-Industry-to-Reach-60-Billion-by-2022"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Industry-to-Reach-60-Billion-by-2022" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Industry to Reach $60 Billion by 2022"></a>Sports Betting Industry to Reach $60 Billion by 2022</h1><p>The global sports betting industry is expected to reach $60 billion by 2022, according to a new report from Market realist. The industry is currently valued at $41 billion and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% over the next five years. This reflects rising interest in sports betting across the globe, as well as the increasing legalization of gambling in many countries.</p>
<p>The report notes that the United States accounted for more than half of the global sports betting market in 2017, with a value of $25.3 billion. This reflects the country’s large population and its avid interest in sport. However, the market is expected to grow rapidly in other regions over the next five years, especially in Asia Pacific and Latin America.</p>
<p>The Asia Pacific region is forecast to be the fastest-growing market, with a CAGR of 11.9% over the next five years. This reflects rising incomes and increased leisure spending in countries such as China and India. In addition, several countries in this region are moving towards legalizing gambling, which will spur further growth in the sports betting market.</p>
<p>Latin America is also expected to experience strong growth, with a CAGR of 11%. This reflects increasing demand for gambling services in countries such as Mexico and Brazil. In addition, many of these countries have recently legalized gambling, which is expected to provide a boost to the sports betting market.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Sportsbooks-Lose-Over-4-Million-in-July"><a href="#Nevada-Sportsbooks-Lose-Over-4-Million-in-July" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sportsbooks Lose Over $4 Million in July"></a>Nevada Sportsbooks Lose Over $4 Million in July</h1><p>According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Nevada sportsbooks lost over $4 million in July. This is the first time they have lost money in July since 2006.</p>
<p>The culprit for the losses were the Cleveland Cavaliers, who went on a historic run in the NBA Finals, upsetting the Golden State Warriors. The Cavaliers were given astronomically high odds to win the series, and as a result, almost all of the sportsbooks in Nevada suffered large losses.</p>
<p>In total, sportsbooks lost $7 million on basketball in June and July. This comes after they earned a record $27 million on basketball during the 2016-2017 season. Unfortunately for them,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> that was not enough to cover their losses from this year’s NBA Finals.</p>
<p>It’s not just basketball that has been causing problems for Nevada sportsbooks recently; football has also been a major issue. In September alone, sportsbooks lost over $1 million on football. This comes after they made a profit of over $10 million on football during the 2016-2017 season.</p>
<p>It’s clear that sports betting is becoming increasingly difficult in Nevada, as teams are getting better and more popular bets are being placed. A lot of this has to do with legalized gambling becoming more widespread across the United States. As fans continue to bet on their favorite teams, the sportsbooks are going to continue to suffer losses.</p>
<h1 id="US-Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-on-Sports-Betting"><a href="#US-Supreme-Court-Strikes-Down-Federal-Ban-on-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="US Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Sports Betting"></a>US Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban on Sports Betting</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that bans sports betting across the country. The decision could pave the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>The ruling comes in response to a case challenging the constitutionality of the 1992 law, which was passed in response to concerns that widespread legalized sports betting would corrupt the nation’s sporting events. New Jersey, which is behind the legal challenge, has pushed for legalization of sports betting in order to help its struggling casino industry.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 ruling, the justices found that the law violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution, which reserves powers not specifically granted to the federal government to the states. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that Congress cannot compel states to keep their laws in line with federal regulations.</p>
<p>Many experts expect other states to follow New Jersey’s lead and begin pushing for legalization of sports betting. This could lead to a nationwide patchwork of laws governing sports betting, with different states offering different levels of regulation and oversight.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Authorizes-Sports-Betting-at-Three-Casinos"><a href="#Delaware-Authorizes-Sports-Betting-at-Three-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Authorizes Sports Betting at Three Casinos"></a>Delaware Authorizes Sports Betting at Three Casinos</h1><p>On Tuesday, Delaware became the first U.S. state to allow full-scale sports betting outside of Nevada. The new law permits sports betting at three casinos in the state: Dover Downs, Harrington Raceway, and Delaware Park. Race tracks and casinos have been able to offer limited sports betting in Delaware since 2009, but the new law allows for wagers on all professional sports and college games.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Governor John Carney said that he expects sports betting to generate $7 million in revenue for Delaware in its first year alone.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it will contribute to gambling addiction and lead to other social ills. Some lawmakers also expressed concern that the new law would violate federal law, which prohibits most forms of sports betting across the country.</p>
<p>Delaware is not the only state considering legalizing sports betting. Last month, New Jersey became the second state (after Nevada) to overturn a federal ban on sports betting. In May, West Virginia passed a bill authorizing sports betting at its four racetracks. Other states, including Pennsylvania and Illinois, are also considering legislation to legalize sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Takes-First-Legal-Sports-Bets"><a href="#New-Jersey-Takes-First-Legal-Sports-Bets" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Takes First Legal Sports Bets"></a>New Jersey Takes First Legal Sports Bets</h1><p>On Thursday, June 14th, New Jersey became the first US state to offer legal sports betting after the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban that prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting.</p>
<p>The state’s racetracks and casinos immediately began taking bets, with the FanDuel Sportsbook at the Meadowlands Racetrack accounting for about half of all the money wagered in the first day. The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City took in $500,000 worth of bets on its first day of operation.</p>
<p>According to projections by the American Gaming Association, about $4.7 billion will be wagered on sports in New Jersey this year, with about $1.5 billion of that being illegal bets.</p>
<p>But even with New Jersey taking the lead on legalizing sports betting, it is still estimated that only about 3 percent of all bets placed on sporting events in the United States will be through legal channels. This is largely due to prohibitions on sports betting remaining in place in most other states.</p>
<p>Delaware may be next up to legalize sports betting as its legislators have already voted to allow it, with Governor John Carney expected to sign the bill into law soon. Other states are also considering legalizing sports gambling, including West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>
