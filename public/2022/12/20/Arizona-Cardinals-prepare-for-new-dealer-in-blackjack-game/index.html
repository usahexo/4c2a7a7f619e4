However, they have not been able to make it to the Super Bowl, losing in the NFC championship game the past two seasons.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this could be that they have been playing with an disadvantageous deck in blackjack. Their dealer, who has been with them for the past few years, has not been a good one. This year, they are looking to replace him with a new dealer, who will give them a more even playing field.</p>
<p>There are many different dealers who would be available for the Cardinals to chose from. Some of the more notable ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dealers from Las Vegas casinos such as MGM or Caesars Palace</p>
</li>
<li><p>Former professional athletes such as Jerry Rice or Deion Sanders</p>
</li>
<li><p>Television personalities such as Pat Sajak or Alex Trebek</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whoever they choose, the Cardinals are confident that they will be able to finally make it to the Super Bowl this year.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Cardinals-to-introduce-new-dealer-in-blackjack-game"><a href="#Arizona-Cardinals-to-introduce-new-dealer-in-blackjack-game" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Cardinals to introduce new dealer in blackjack game"></a>Arizona Cardinals to introduce new dealer in blackjack game</h1><p> Cardinals owner, Bill Bidwill, has announced that the team is set to introduce a new dealer in their blackjack game for the upcoming season. The Cardinals have not had a winning season since 2009 and are looking to turn their fortunes around with this change.</p>
<p>The team has not revealed any specifics about the new dealer but they promise that he or she will be someone who can help the Cardinals win. “This is an important decision for our team and we are confident that we have found the right person to help us win,” said Bidwill in a statement released to the media.</p>
<p>Cardinals fans are hopeful that this change will help them win games this season. The NFL season kicks off in September and Arizona will be looking to start strong with their new dealer in place.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Cardinals-to-switch-dealers-during-blackjack-game"><a href="#Arizona-Cardinals-to-switch-dealers-during-blackjack-game" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Cardinals to switch dealers during blackjack game"></a>Arizona Cardinals to switch dealers during blackjack game</h1><p>The Arizona Cardinals are reportedly switching dealers during their blackjack game against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>According to sources, the team has lost faith in their current dealer, who has not been dealt a good hand this season.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to give ourselves the best chance to win,” said Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians. “Our players have confidence in our new dealer and we’re hopeful that this will be the switch that turns our season around.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals have not had a winning record since 2015 and are currently 3-9-1 this season.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-to-rotate-among-different-Arizona-Cardinals-players"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-to-rotate-among-different-Arizona-Cardinals-players" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer to rotate among different Arizona Cardinals players"></a>Blackjack Dealer to rotate among different Arizona Cardinals players</h1><p>The Arizona Cardinals have been making some noise in the NFL this season. And with a current record of 7-8, they are still in the running for a playoff spot. One of the things that has made them successful is their team chemistry. But as we all know, things can change quickly in the NFL, and teams can go from contenders to pretenders in a hurry.</p>
<p>Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury knows this, which is why he is already making contingency plans in case one or more of his key players gets injured. Recently, Kingsbury announced that the team’s blackjack dealer will rotate among different players, depending on who is playing that week.</p>
<p>“It’s all about maximizing our potential and giving ourselves the best chance to win,” said Kingbury. “If one of our players is injured, we need to have someone else ready to step up and take his place. The blackjack dealer is a key part of our team, and we need to be sure that we have enough depth at that position.”</p>
<p>Kingsbury isn’t the only coach who is looking for depth at the blackjack dealer position. In fact, most NFL teams now view the position as being critical to their success. That’s because the blackjack dealer has emerged as one of the most important players on the field. He or she is responsible for dealing cards, monitoring the game clock, and handling any other administrative tasks that may come up during the course of a game.</p>
<p>In addition, the blackjack dealer is often called upon to make strategic decisions under pressure. He or she may need to adjust the game plan on short notice if one of the players goes down with an injury or if there is a change in playing strategy by the other team. This can be a daunting task for anyone, but it is especially challenging for someone who has little or no experience dealing with professional athletes.</p>
<p>That’s why it is so important for NFL teams to have quality backup dealers who can step in if needed. And while many teams are still searching for someone who can fill this role effectively, the Cardinals believe they have found just what they need in their rotating cast of blackjack dealers.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Cardinals-to-have-a-new-dealer-every-other-hand-in-blackjack"><a href="#Arizona-Cardinals-to-have-a-new-dealer-every-other-hand-in-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Cardinals to have a new dealer every other hand in blackjack"></a>Arizona Cardinals to have a new dealer every other hand in blackjack</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, the Arizona Cardinals have decided to change their dealer for blackjack at every other hand. This is a drastic change for the team, who has previously had the same dealer for the entire game.</p>
<p>“We just felt that it was time for a change,” said head coach Bruce Arians. “We’re always looking to improve our performance, and we think this will help us do that.”</p>
<p>The new dealers will be rotated in every other hand, in an effort to keep things fresh and exciting. This is a new strategy for the Cardinals, who have never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>“It’s all about trying something new and different,” said Arians. “We think this will add some excitement to the game, and it could help us win more games.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals are coming off of a disappointing season, where they finished with a 7-8-1 record. They are hoping that this new strategy will help them rebound in 2017.</p>
