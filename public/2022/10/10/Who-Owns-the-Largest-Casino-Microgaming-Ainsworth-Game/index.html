            <h1 id="Who-Owns-the-Largest-Casino-Microgaming-Ainsworth-Game"><a href="#Who-Owns-the-Largest-Casino-Microgaming-Ainsworth-Game" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns the Largest Casino Microgaming Ainsworth Game?"></a>Who Owns the Largest Casino Microgaming Ainsworth Game?</h1><p>In the gambling industry, there are a handful of casino software providers who truly dominate the market. Microgaming and Playtech are two of the biggest names in the business, but a little-known company called Ainsworth Game Technology is beginning to make a name for itself.</p>
<p>Ainsworth has been around for over two decades and is headquartered in Australia. The company has a strong presence in the land-based gambling market, but it is quickly making inroads into the online space as well. Ainsworth’s games are popular with players due to their innovative features and exciting gameplay.</p>
<p>One of the company’s most popular titles is Buffalo Thunder, which is a slot machine that takes players on a journey through the American Southwest. The game’s graphics and sounds are top-notch, and it offers up some impressive payouts as well.</p>
<p>Ainsworth also enjoys a strong relationship with Aristocrat, which is another big player in the casino software market. The two companies have worked together to create some of the most popular slot machines on the planet. Titles like More Cash and Party Time are perfect examples of how well these two companies can work together.</p>
<p>As Ainsworth continues to grow, it will be interesting to see how it competes against industry giants like Microgaming and Playtech. The company has already proven that it can hold its own against the best of them, so there is no reason to believe that it won’t continue to thrive in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Australian-Gaming-Billionaire-Buys-Out-Casino-Microgaming-Ainsworth-Game"><a href="#Australian-Gaming-Billionaire-Buys-Out-Casino-Microgaming-Ainsworth-Game" class="headerlink" title="Australian Gaming Billionaire Buys Out Casino Microgaming Ainsworth Game"></a>Australian Gaming Billionaire Buys Out Casino Microgaming Ainsworth Game</h1><p>Technology Limited (ASX:AGI), the prominent Australian</p>
<p>gambling software company, has agreed to a takeover bid from</p>
<p>Gaming Ventures Limited (GVL), an affiliate of billionaire casino</p>
<p>magnate James Packer. The all-cash offer values AGI at $1.27 billion,</p>
<p>representing a 40% premium on the company’s current market value.</p>
<p>The deal will see AGI become a private company, with Packer taking a</p>
<p>majority stake in the business. AGI’s management team, led by CEO</p>
<p>David Greene and CFO Tony Gooch, will remain in place and continue to</p>
<p>run the business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of</p>
<p>2018, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.</p>
<pre><code>For Greene and Gooch, who founded AGI in 2001, the offer is an
</code></pre>
<p>unprecedented opportunity to cash out their years of hard work and create lasting wealth for themselves and their employees. “This is an amazing outcome for our shareholders,” said Greene in a statement. “Our focus has always been on creating shareholder value, and we are thrilled to have reached an agreement that delivers such a strong premium.”    The proposed sale comes at a time of significant growth for AGI. The company’s adjusted net profit jumped 55% in fiscal 2017, thanks to strong demand for its casino games across the world. In March 2018, AGI signed a landmark deal with MGM Resorts International to supply its games to the US gaming giant’s online casino site.</p>
<p>   GVL is being advised by global investment bank Morgan Stanley on the transaction.</p>

For one, online casinos offer players more convenience and flexibility than traditional casinos. Players can access their favourite games from anywhere at any time, and they can do so without leaving the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, online casinos typically offer more game varieties than traditional casinos, which means that players can find the perfect game for their needs and preferences.</p>
<p>Another reason for the industry’s booming popularity is advancements in technology. With each new technological advancement, online casinos are able to offer players an even better gaming experience. VR casinos, for example, allow players to experience the excitement and adrenaline of a real-life casino from the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p>And finally, one of the primary drivers of the industry’s growth is its ever-growing popularity among millennials. This age group has grown up with technology, so they are much more comfortable playing games online than older generations. They also have more discretionary income available to spend on gambling games.</p>
<p>So what does the future hold for the online casino industry? There is no doubt that it will continue to grow in popularity among millennials and other age groups. Additionally, technological advancements will continue to drive innovation in the industry, offering players an even better gaming experience. Finally, we can expect to see even more mergers and acquisitions within the industry as companies battle it out for market share.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Microgaming-AinsworthGame-Sold-to-Australian-Gaming-Company"><a href="#Casino-Microgaming-AinsworthGame-Sold-to-Australian-Gaming-Company" class="headerlink" title="Casino Microgaming AinsworthGame Sold to Australian Gaming Company"></a>Casino Microgaming AinsworthGame Sold to Australian Gaming Company</h1><p>The CasinoMicrogaming AinsworthGame has been sold to an Australian listed gaming company.</p>
<p>The all-cash deal, which is expected to complete in the coming weeks, will see the Las Vegas-based casino gaming supplier merge with Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd (AGT), a leading Australian gaming company and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of slot machines.</p>
<p>Casino Microgaming AinsworthGame shareholders are set to receive AUD$4 per share, valuing the company at over AUD$560 million.</p>
<p>AGT shareholders will own approximately 60% of the merged company, with CasinoMicrogaming AinsworthGame shareholders owning the remaining 40%.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, AGT Chairman Les Wicks said: “We are very excited about this merger as it will create a world-leading gaming company with a strong product offering and global footprint.”</p>
<p>CasinoMicrogaming AinsworthGame CEO Matt Davey added: “This is great news for our shareholders and employees. The merger will provide our team with access to new markets and technologies, while also giving us a much stronger balance sheet which will allow us to invest in new products and services.”</p>
