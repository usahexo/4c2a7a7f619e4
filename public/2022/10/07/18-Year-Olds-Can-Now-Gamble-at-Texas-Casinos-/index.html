The measure to allow young adults into casinos was approved by the state’s House of Representatives last week and now awaits the signature of Governor Greg Abbott.</p>
<p>Casinos will be able to set their own minimum age requirement, but the state’s current legal gambling age of 21 will still apply to other forms of gambling, including bingo, the lottery, and race betting.</p>
<p>The lifting of the ban is expected to bring an additional $20 million in revenue to the state each year. Casinos have been pushing for the change for years, arguing that it would help them recruit a new generation of customers.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure point to research that suggests that casino gambling can be addictive and harmful to young people. They also argue that it can be difficult for 18-year-olds to resist peer pressure to gamble.</p>
<p>Governor Abbott has not yet said whether he will sign the measure into law.</p>
<h1 id="You-Must-Be-21-to-Play-in-Texas-Casinos-from-Now-On"><a href="#You-Must-Be-21-to-Play-in-Texas-Casinos-from-Now-On" class="headerlink" title="You Must Be 21 to Play in Texas Casinos from Now On"></a>You Must Be 21 to Play in Texas Casinos from Now On</h1><p>As of September 1, 2019, you must be 21 to play in Texas casinos. The new law is designed to help protect people from gambling addiction and other negative consequences associated with casino gaming.</p>
<p>Sponsored by State Representative Geanie Morrison, House Bill No. 1908 requires players to be of legal gambling age in order to participate in casino games such as slots, blackjack, poker, and roulette.</p>
<p>Morrison, who authored the bill, said that it will help to safeguard Texans from the dangers of gambling addiction. “This legislation will help ensure that our citizens are protected from the harmful effects of gambling while also helping to promote responsible gaming practices,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Texas casinos currently have an age limit of 18 for most games, but the new law will raise the age requirement to 21 for all casino games. It will also prohibit anyone under 21 from collecting winnings or entering into a contract with a casino.</p>
<p>The measure was passed unanimously by the Texas House of Representatives and now goes to Governor Greg Abbott for his signature.</p>
<h1 id="New-Casino-Age-Limit-Goes-into-Effect-in-Texas-on-Wednesday"><a href="#New-Casino-Age-Limit-Goes-into-Effect-in-Texas-on-Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="New Casino Age Limit Goes into Effect in Texas on Wednesday"></a>New Casino Age Limit Goes into Effect in Texas on Wednesday</h1><p>Beginning Wednesday, September 1, those wanting to enter a casino in Texas must be at least 21 years old. The new age limit is one of several regulations the Texas State Legislature imposed on the gambling industry this year.</p>
<p>The change in regulation was prompted by complaints from some lawmakers and members of the public that casinos were becoming a haven for underage gamblers. “We looked at other states and determined that this was an industry best practice,” said Republican state Rep. Barbara Nash, one of the authors of House Bill 2158, which instituted the new age requirement.</p>
<p>Casinos are not happy with the new rule. “This is going to have a significant impact on our business,” said Wayne Townsend, president and CEO of WinStar World Casino and Resort in Thackerville. The casino, which is just south of the Oklahoma border, employs more than 2,000 people and generates more than $1 billion in economic activity each year.</p>
<p>Townsend said that his casino has put together a task force to come up with a plan to deal with the new age limit. He estimates that the casino will lose about $50 million in revenue as a result of the change. Other casinos in Texas are expected to be similarly impacted.</p>
<p>Supporters of the change say it is necessary to protect young people from getting addicted to gambling at an early age. “We don’t want our young people becoming addicts and ruining their lives,” said Nash.</p>
<h1 id="Texans-Can-Only-Gamble-at-Casinos-If-They-Are-21-or-Older"><a href="#Texans-Can-Only-Gamble-at-Casinos-If-They-Are-21-or-Older" class="headerlink" title="Texans Can Only Gamble at Casinos If They Are 21 or Older"></a>Texans Can Only Gamble at Casinos If They Are 21 or Older</h1><p>Houston, TX – According to a new law in the state of Texas, only those who are 21 years or older will be able to gamble at casinos.</p>
<p>Republican State Representative Rick Miller sponsored the bill, which was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott on June 9th. The law goes into effect on September 1st.</p>
<p>It had been illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble in Texas, but there were no specific penalties in place for those caught doing so. This new law will make it a misdemeanor crime for those caught gambling underage, punishable by a fine of up to $500.</p>
<p>Miller said in a statement that “this bill will help keep our young people safe while also protecting the rights of casino employees and businesses.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it criminalizes an act that is currently only a civil offense and could lead to more minors being arrested. They also question whether or not the law will actually be effective in keeping minors from gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-Age-to-Gamble-in-Texas-Casinos-Raised-to-21"><a href="#Minimum-Age-to-Gamble-in-Texas-Casinos-Raised-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum Age to Gamble in Texas Casinos Raised to 21"></a>Minimum Age to Gamble in Texas Casinos Raised to 21</h1><p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has recently signed a bill into law that will raise the minimum age to gamble in casinos from 18 to 21. The new law takes effect on September 1, 2019.</p>
<p>The bill was authored by Representative Eddie Lucio III and sponsored by Senator John Cornyn. It was passed unanimously by both the Texas House of Representatives and Senate.</p>
<p>In a statement, Lucio said that the legislation would help protect young people from the harmful effects of gambling addiction. “This commonsense measure will help protect our young people from developing a gambling addiction, which can have long-term negative consequences on their lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a real problem, and can have devastating consequences for those affected by it. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, relationship problems, job loss, and even suicide.</p>
<p> Increasing the minimum age to gamble in casinos will help to protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction. It will also help to reduce the number of people who develop problem gambling habits.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no opposition to the new law. Raising the minimum age to gamble in casinos is a common-sense measure that will help protect young people from harm. Thanks to Governor Abbott for signing it into law!</p>
