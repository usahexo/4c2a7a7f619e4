            <h1 id="What-is-Wolf-Moon-Rising"><a href="#What-is-Wolf-Moon-Rising" class="headerlink" title="What is Wolf Moon Rising?"></a>What is Wolf Moon Rising?</h1><p>Wolf Moon Rising is a term used in modern astrology to describe the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth that creates a larger than average sized full moon. The phenomena typically occurs in January, when the Sun is in Capricorn and the Moon is in Leo.</p>
<p>The exact moment of the Wolf Moon Rising can vary depending on your location, but it’s typically around January 1–2 or January 12-13. Stargazers can enjoy this spectacular event by looking to the east horizon around sunset.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Enhanced sense of well-being and connection to others</p>

<h1 id="What-is-the-Wolf-Moon-Rising-Game"><a href="#What-is-the-Wolf-Moon-Rising-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Wolf Moon Rising Game?"></a>What is the Wolf Moon Rising Game?</h1><p>The Wolf Moon Rising Game is an upcoming PlayStation 4 and PC game being developed by indie studio Ghost Games. According to the game’s website, Wolf Moon Rising is a “third person action RPG set in a time of werewolves, vampires and magic”. Players will take control of a “half-breed” named Ethan as he strives to uncover the secrets of his past, defend his home from supernatural threats, and find his place in the world.</p>
<p>In Wolf Moon Rising, players will explore a large open world filled with dangerous creatures and mysterious locations. They’ll also be able to team up with friends to take on cooperative challenges, or compete head-to-head in PvP combat. The game is expected to release in 2020.</p>
<h1 id="What-We-Know-So-Far"><a href="#What-We-Know-So-Far" class="headerlink" title="What We Know So Far"></a>What We Know So Far</h1><p>Based on the limited information currently available, Wolf Moon Rising seems to occupy something of a middle ground between games like Skyrim and The Witcher 3, combining RPG elements with fast-paced action gameplay. This could make for an interesting experience, especially when played with friends.</p>
<p>The game’s website also mentions that Ethan is a “half-breed”, which could imply that players will have the opportunity to choose their character’s class and customize their abilities. This would be a welcome addition for RPG fans, and could help set Wolf Moon Rising apart from its competitors.</p>
<p>Wolf Moon Rising is scheduled for release in 2020, but no specific date has been announced yet. In the meantime, you can check out the game’s website or follow Ghost Games on Twitter for more information as it becomes available.</p>
