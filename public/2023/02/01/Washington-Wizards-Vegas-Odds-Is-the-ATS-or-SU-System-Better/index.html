            <h1 id="Washington-Wizards-Vegas-Odds-Is-the-ATS-or-SU-System-Better"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-Vegas-Odds-Is-the-ATS-or-SU-System-Better" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards Vegas Odds: Is the ATS or SU System Better?"></a>Washington Wizards Vegas Odds: Is the ATS or SU System Better?</h1><p>The Washington Wizards are a team that is starting to heat up as the NBA season progresses. Currently, they are in the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 23-21 record. As they continue to progress, many people are curious about their odds for the playoffs and other future endeavors. In this article, we will look at the Washington Wizards Vegas Odds and evaluate which betting system is better: ATS or SU.</p>
<p>To start off, let’s take a look at Washington’s ATS record. So far this season, they are 17-16 when it comes to covering the spread. This means that they have won more games than they have lost when the point spread is taken into account. On the surface, this looks like a good record; however, when you take a closer look at their games, you will see that their ATS record is actually inflated.</p>
<p>Many of Washington’s wins came against bad teams, such as the Atlanta Hawks and Phoenix Suns. Meanwhile, they have also lost against some good teams, such as the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets. If you remove these teams from the equation, Washington’s ATS record would be significantly worse. In fact, they would only be 8-10 against the spread; which would place them in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>While their ATS record isn’t as bad as it seems at first glance, their SU record is even worse. So far this season, Washington has only won 20 of their 43 games outright. This means that their winning percentage sits at only .465%. If you compare this to last year’s winning percentage of .512%, you can see that Washington has been on a slight decline.</p>
<p>This trend is also seen when you break down their wins by conference. So far this season, Washington has won six out of eleven games against Eastern Conference opponents; while they have only won fourteen out of thirty two games against Western Conference opponents. This shows that Washington struggles against good teams from outside their conference.</p>
<p>So what does all of this mean for the Washington Wizards Vegas Odds? Essentially, it means that their ATS system isn’t as good as it seems and that their SU system is even worse! In order to make money betting on Washington, it might be wiser to betting against them when they are listed as favorites and picking them when they are underdogs</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-ATS-Stats-Does-the-Trend-Hold-Up"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-ATS-Stats-Does-the-Trend-Hold-Up" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards ATS Stats: Does the Trend Hold Up?"></a>Washington Wizards ATS Stats: Does the Trend Hold Up?</h1><p>Washington Wizards are in the playoff discussion this year and they will be looking to improve on their ATS stats from last season. The Wizards had a record of 43-39 against the spread last year, which was good for 8th in the Eastern Conference. They were also one of the better teams in terms of covering the spread as a favorite; they went 27-14 (64%) in games where they were favored. Washington was not as successful when they were the underdog, going just 16-25 (40%) in those games.</p>
<p>Looking at their stats so far this season, it is clear that the Wizards have been a different team against the spread. They have a record of 5-10 against the spread and are just 2-5 as a favorite. Washington has played better as an underdog, going 3-5 in those games. One reason for their struggles against the spread this season has been their inability to cover big spreads; the Wizards have lost outright as a favorite by at least 14 points twice this season.</p>
<p>While Washington’s ATS stats so far this season are not impressive, it is important to remember that they are still a very talented team. The Eastern Conference is wide open this year and Washington has a chance to make some noise in the playoffs. If they can get back to playing like they did last season against the spread, they become a very dangerous team to bet on.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-SU-Betting-Which-is-the-Stronger-System"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-SU-Betting-Which-is-the-Stronger-System" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards SU Betting: Which is the Stronger System?"></a>Washington Wizards SU Betting: Which is the Stronger System?</h1><p>In order to determine which of the Washington Wizards SU betting systems is stronger, it is important to first look at what each system entails.</p>
<p>The first system is a simple moneyline approach in which players bet on the Wizards to win outright, regardless of the point spread. The second system is based on the point spread and calls for players to bet on the Wizards when they are favored or against them when they are underdogs.</p>
<p>To begin with, let’s take a look at how the Washington Wizards have fared both as favorites and underdogs this season.</p>
<p>As Favorites: In games in which the Wizards were favored by 6.5 points or more, they went 7-4 SU. In games in which they were favored by 5 points or less, they went just 2-4 SU. This suggests that the system based on point spreads is more successful when the Wizards are playing with a smaller margin of victory expected.</p>
<p>As Underdogs: In games in which the Wizards were underdogs by 6.5 points or more, they went 1-3 SU. In games in which they were underdogs by 5 points or less, they went 4-1 SU. This suggests that the system based on point spreads is more successful when the Wizards are playing as underdogs.</p>
<p>When taking all of this information into account, it would appear that the system based on point spreads is the stronger of the two Washington Wizards SU betting systems.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-ATS-Record-What-Does-Stand-in-Terms-of-Betting"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-ATS-Record-What-Does-Stand-in-Terms-of-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards ATS Record: What Does Stand in Terms of Betting?"></a>Washington Wizards ATS Record: What Does Stand in Terms of Betting?</h1><p>The Washington Wizards are coming into the 2019-2020 NBA season with plenty of excitement and promise. They have an All-Star duo in John Wall and Bradley Beal, as well as some solid role players. That being said, what can we expect from them in terms of their ATS record?</p>
<p>First and foremost, Washington’s ATS record is typically good. They generally cover the spread, which is great news for bettors. In the 2018-2019 season, they finished with a 44-38-2 ATS record. This means that they covered the spread about 54% of the time. While this isn’t a perfect record, it’s still fairly impressive.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to this upcoming season, Washington is once again expected to be one of the better teams in the Eastern Conference. As a result, they will likely be favored in many of their games. In fact, Bovada has them pegged as a +175 underdog to win the East (second best odds only behind Milwaukee).</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for their ATS record? Well, if they can live up to expectations and win a good chunk of their games outright, then their ATS record should be fairly good once again. Bettors can expect them to cover the spread more often than not. However, there is always some risk when betting on any team, so make sure you do your research before placing any bets.</p>
<h1 id="SU-or-ATS-What-Does-Work-Best-for-Betting-on-Washington-Wizards"><a href="#SU-or-ATS-What-Does-Work-Best-for-Betting-on-Washington-Wizards" class="headerlink" title="SU or ATS: What Does Work Best for Betting on Washington Wizards"></a>SU or ATS: What Does Work Best for Betting on Washington Wizards</h1><p>Washington Wizards have been a hot topic in the NBA world this season. Many teams would love to snatch John Wall and Bradley Beal from Washington, but it doesn’t seem like the Wizards are going anywhere for now.</p>
<p>That means that if you’re looking to place some bets on Wizards games, you’ll need to know which betting system works best for them: SU or ATS?</p>
<p>SU stands for “straight up,” which means that you’re only betting on whether or not Washington will win the game. ATS, on the other hand, stands for “against the spread.” This type of bet takes into account the point spread — i.e., how many points one team is expected to beat another by.</p>
<p>So which one should you choose when betting on Washington Wizards games?</p>
<p>The answer largely depends on what kind of gambler you are. If you’re someone who prefers to go with your gut instinct and bet on who you think will win, then SU is probably the way to go. However, if you’re more interested in hedging your bets and trying to maximize your potential winnings, then ATS may be a better option.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that neither system is foolproof; there will always be ups and downs no matter which route you take. But if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning money on Washington Wizards games, then understanding the difference between SU and ATS is a good place to start.</p>
