            <h1 id="NFL-won’t-want-to-associate-with-gambling-site"><a href="#NFL-won’t-want-to-associate-with-gambling-site" class="headerlink" title="NFL won’t want to associate with gambling site"></a>NFL won’t want to associate with gambling site</h1><p>The NFL has been making moves over the past few years to distance themselves from gambling, and it is unlikely that they will want to associate themselves with a gambling website like DraftKings.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, the NFL banned players from participating in fantasy football leagues that involved real-money wagers. The league stated at the time that the decision was made in order to protect the “integrity of the game.”</p>
<p>And more recently, the NFL has been vocal about its opposition to legalized sports betting. In March of this year, the league issued a statement saying that it “remains steadfast in its opposition to legalized sports betting.”</p>
<p>So it’s clear that the NFL doesn’t want to be associated with gambling in any way. And given that DraftKings is a gambling website, it’s highly unlikely that the league would want to partner with them.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-doesn’t-want-to-be-associated-with-any-form-of-gambling"><a href="#NFL-doesn’t-want-to-be-associated-with-any-form-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="NFL doesn’t want to be associated with any form of gambling"></a>NFL doesn’t want to be associated with any form of gambling</h1><p>The NFL has made it very clear that it does not want to be associated with any form of gambling. This is likely due to the fact that the NFL is a publicly traded company and gambling can be seen as a form of risk.</p>
<p>The NFL has gone so far as to ban players from participating in fantasy football leagues, which are considered a form of gambling. In July of 2017, the NFL announced a new policy that would fine players and teams if they participated in fantasy football leagues.</p>
<p>This new policy was met with criticism by many players and fans. Some argued that the NFL was trying to take away a source of entertainment for fans, while others argued that the NFL was just trying to protect itself from any legal issues that may arise from fantasy football leagues.</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the NFL has made it clear that it does not want to be associated with gambling in any way.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-feels-sports-betting-takes-away-from-the-integrity-of-the-sport"><a href="#NFL-feels-sports-betting-takes-away-from-the-integrity-of-the-sport" class="headerlink" title="NFL feels sports betting takes away from the integrity of the sport"></a>NFL feels sports betting takes away from the integrity of the sport</h1><p>On Wednesday, June 6, the NFL sent a cease and desist letter to the New Jersey Legislature regarding the state’s plan to allow sports betting. In the letter, the NFL said that it “believes that legalized sports betting threatens the integrity of our game.”</p>
<p>This is not a new stance for the NFL. The league has been outspoken against sports betting for years. In 1992, then-commissioner Paul Tagliabue testified before Congress that “the integrity of sport is at stake” when it comes to gambling on games.</p>
<p>NFL officials worry that if sports betting is legalized, players and coaches might be influenced to fix games in order to make money off of bets. They also believe that fans might bet on games illegally instead of attending them in person, which could lead to a decline in ticket sales and TV ratings.</p>
<p>Others argue that legalizing sports betting would actually help preserve the integrity of the game. They say that it would create a regulated environment where bets are placed fairly and transparently. This would make it more difficult for anyone to fix a game or engage in other shady activities.</p>
<p>The issue of sports betting is a complicated one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. What do you think? Should the NFL be worried about the integrity of its sport, or is this simply another case of them clinging to antiquated beliefs?</p>
<h1 id="NFL-doesn’t-want-its-players-or-teams-being-used-as-a-marketing-tool-for-a-gambling-site"><a href="#NFL-doesn’t-want-its-players-or-teams-being-used-as-a-marketing-tool-for-a-gambling-site" class="headerlink" title="NFL doesn’t want its players or teams being used as a marketing tool for a gambling site"></a>NFL doesn’t want its players or teams being used as a marketing tool for a gambling site</h1><p>The NFL has issued a warning to its players and teams not to use their likenesses for marketing or promotional purposes with newly-launched gambling site, Bet365.</p>
<p>“We have been clear with our teams and players that they are not to promote or associate with any commercial gambling interests, including the use of team names, logos, players’ images or otherwise,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy wrote in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bet365 is among a flurry of gambling sites that have recently secured licenses from the state of New Jersey in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn a federal law that had effectively outlawed sports betting across most of the country.</p>
<p>NFL teams and players are already prohibited from having any affiliation with casinos and other gambling establishments. The league has long been leery of any connection between its games and sports betting, which it considers a threat to the integrity of its product.</p>
<p>“The NFL’s longstanding policy is that casino-related content and activities are prohibited for our players and team members because they are inconsistent with our values and commitment to promoting responsible gaming,” McCarthy said.</p>
<h1 id="NFL-doesn’t-want-its-fans-placing-bets-on-games"><a href="#NFL-doesn’t-want-its-fans-placing-bets-on-games" class="headerlink" title="NFL doesn’t want its fans placing bets on games"></a>NFL doesn’t want its fans placing bets on games</h1><p>The NFL has been around since 1920 and is now a multi-billion dollar industry. Over the years, the league has tried to distance itself from gambling, but with the increasing popularity of legalized sports betting, that is becoming more difficult. In 1992, then-NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue wrote a letter to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in which he stated that the NFL did not want its fans placing bets on games.</p>
<p>“We are strongly opposed to any form of legalized gambling on NFL games,” Tagliabue said at the time. “It is fundamental to the integrity of our sport.”</p>
<p>Today, the NFL is still against sports betting, but the league has softened its stance somewhat. In a recent interview with ESPN, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that he was open to discussing the possibility of legalized sports betting and that the league would be willing to partner with casinos and state governments if it were to become legal.</p>
<p>“I think we have to be open to it,” Goodell said. “We’re not close-minded to it.”</p>
<p>Goodell’s comments come as no surprise given the mounting evidence that legalized sports betting is here to stay. In May, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting, and since then several states have moved forward with legalization plans. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey and West Virginia have all already begun taking bets on NFL games, and many other states are expected to follow suit in the near future.</p>
<p>The fact that the NFL is now openly discussing legalized sports betting signals a major shift in its thinking on the issue. The league has long been opposed to gambling because of the potential for corruption, but with states beginning to legalize sports betting it can no longer afford to ignore the issue. Goodell’s comments suggest that the NFL is now prepared to accept legalized sports betting as a reality and is looking for ways to make sure that it is done in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
