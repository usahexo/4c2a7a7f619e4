<p>Mandela was born in South Africa in 1918, and rose to prominence as a leader of the anti-apartheid movement. After years of imprisonment and exile, he was eventually elected President of South Africa in 1994. As president, Mandela devoted himself to forging a new democracy and healing the scars of apartheid.</p>
<p>Mandela’s tireless work for human rights won him numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. His legacy will be remembered for generations to come.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Nelson Mandela. You will be missed.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Poker-Legend-Nelson-Mandela-Dies-at-95"><a href="#Indian-Poker-Legend-Nelson-Mandela-Dies-at-95" class="headerlink" title="Indian Poker Legend, Nelson Mandela Dies at 95"></a>Indian Poker Legend, Nelson Mandela Dies at 95</h1><p>Nelson Mandela, the iconic South African leader and esteemed world statesman, has passed away at 95 years old. Widely regarded as one of the most important political figures of the 20th century, Mandela’s activism against apartheid – South Africa’s institutionalized segregation and discrimination against non-white persons – earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.</p>
<p>Mandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994, becoming the country’s first black head of state. He served one five-year term, stepping down in 1999. After his retirement from politics, Mandela remained a vocal advocate for human rights and AIDS awareness until his death.</p>
<p>Born on July 18, 1918 in the small village of Mvezo, Eastern Cape Province, Nelson Mandela was destined for greatness. The son of a tribal chief, he dedicated himself to the struggle against racism and apartheid from an early age. After studying law at Wits University in Johannesburg, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC), leading its Youth League in 1952. He quickly rose through the ranks of the ANC, becoming its Deputy President in 1959.</p>
<p>In 1962, Mandela was arrested and charged with treason for his role in the ANC’s struggle against apartheid. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on Robben Island, where he served 27 years before being released in 1990 as part of negotiations to end apartheid. Following his release from prison, Nelson Mandela embarked on an illustrious tour around the world, cementing his stature as one of history’s most respected leaders.</p>
<p>A towering figure of moral authority and strength, Nelson Mandela leaves behind a legacy of compassion and reconciliation that will never be forgotten. May he rest in peace.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Poker-Legend-Nelson-Mandela-A-Great-Icon"><a href="#Indian-Poker-Legend-Nelson-Mandela-A-Great-Icon" class="headerlink" title="Indian Poker Legend, Nelson Mandela A Great Icon"></a>Indian Poker Legend, Nelson Mandela A Great Icon</h1><p>Poker is one of the most popular card games in the world. It is a game of strategy, can be very simple or exceedingly complex and can provide hours of entertainment. In Poker, you are playing against other players, not against the house. The object is to win money by either taking cards that make a winning Poker hand, or by bluffing your opponents into folding their cards.</p>
<p>The origin of Poker is shrouded in history but it is generally accepted that it evolved from a 16th century Persian card game called As Nas. Poker was brought to America by French settlers in the early 18th century and soon became popular throughout the country. Cowboys and outlaws were particularly enamored with the game and used their quick wits and nerve to win big pots.</p>
<p>One of the legends of American poker is Nelson Mandela. He was born in Houston, Texas on December 1st, 1933 and raised in Fort Worth. Nelson’s father was a hardworking carpenter who taught his son the importance of discipline and determination. As a youngster, Nelson was fascinated by card games and he quickly learned how to play poker. He soon developed a reputation as a talented player and began winning large sums of money from his opponents.</p>
<p>In 1951, Nelson enlisted in the Marine Corps and saw combat in Korea. After returning home, he resumed his career as a professional poker player. In 1957, he won first place at the World Series of Poker (WSOP), earning him $30,000. This event made him one of the most famous poker players in the world and he would go on to win numerous other titles over the years.</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela was not just a great poker player but also an icon for human rights. In 1993, he was elected President of South Africa and served until 1999. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his work to end apartheid in South Africa. After leaving office, he continued to work for peace and human rights until his death in 2013 at the age of 95.</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela will always be remembered as one of the greatest icons of our time. He was a masterful poker player who never backed down from a challenge and fought tirelessly for human rights worldwide</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Poker-Champion-Nelson-Mandela-Loses-Battle-to-Lung-Infection"><a href="#Indian-Poker-Champion-Nelson-Mandela-Loses-Battle-to-Lung-Infection" class="headerlink" title="Indian Poker Champion Nelson Mandela Loses Battle to Lung Infection"></a>Indian Poker Champion Nelson Mandela Loses Battle to Lung Infection</h1><p>Nelson Mandela, the first black president of South Africa and an iconic figure in the fight against apartheid, died yesterday at age 95 after a long battle with a lung infection.</p>
<p>Mandela’s reputation as a statesman and fighter for human rights was burnished by his 27 years in prison, including 18 years on Robben Island, a windswept island 12 miles off the Cape Town coast used as a maximum security prison. </p>
<p>But it is for his role in leading South Africa from apartheid to democracy that he will be most remembered. He was elected president in 1994 in the country’s first all-race elections and served one five-year term. </p>
<p>In South Africa, poker is considered a game of skill and not gambling. And Nelson Mandela was one of its greatest champions. He was crowned Indian Poker Champion twice – once in 1989 and again in 1991. </p>
<p>It was an unlikely victory for a man who became involved in poker only because he needed to kill time while imprisoned on Robben Island. “There was nothing to do on the island but play cards,” Mandela later recalled. “We would play for hours on end.” </p>
<p>Mandela’s skills at the card table carried over into real-world tournaments after he was released from prison in 1990. He would often beat players who were much younger than him. In one notable match, he defeated a player who had just won $1 million in a poker tournament. </p>
<p>“He was an incredible player,” says casino executive John Lovell, who observed Mandela playing poker many times over the years. “He had an amazing ability to read people.” </p>
<p>Sadly, Mandela’s reign as Indian Poker Champion came to an end with his death yesterday. But his legacy as one of the greats of the game will live on.</p>
<h1 id="Legendary-Indian-Poker-Player-Nelson-Mandela-Dead-at-95"><a href="#Legendary-Indian-Poker-Player-Nelson-Mandela-Dead-at-95" class="headerlink" title="Legendary Indian Poker Player, Nelson Mandela Dead at 95"></a>Legendary Indian Poker Player, Nelson Mandela Dead at 95</h1><p>Legendary Indian Poker Player, Nelson Mandela Dead at 95</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela, the first black president of South Africa and a legendary figure in the world of poker, has died aged 95.</p>
<p>Mandela was an accomplished poker player and spent many years playing in high-stakes cash games across the world. His most notable win came in a game against billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn in Las Vegas in 2009.</p>
<p>“Nelson was one of the most respected and feared players on the circuit,” said Einhorn. “He was a great friend and I will miss him dearly.”</p>
<p>Born in 1918, Mandela was active in the anti-apartheid movement from a young age, eventually being arrested and spending 27 years in prison. He was released in 1990 and won the Nobel Peace Prize later that year. He was elected president of South Africa in 1994 and served until 1999.</p>
<p>Mandela is survived by his wife Graca Machel, six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.</p>
